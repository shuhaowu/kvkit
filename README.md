kvkit
=====

**kvkit** is an object mapper and a RAD tool for key value stores.
This project is a continuation from the project [riakkit][rk] as that
one became slow and buggy, as well as obsolete.

[rk]: https://github.com/shuhaowu/riakkit

kvkit is designed with portability in mind. Backends could be easily
written. The current available backends include: Riak, LevelDB.
